LAI-PrEP Bridge Decision Support Tool
Pharma-Restricted Open Healthcare License v1.0

Copyright (c) 2024-2025 Adrian C. Demidont and Kandis Backus

===============================================================================
PREAMBLE
===============================================================================

This license is designed to maximize public health impact while ensuring that
pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and medical device 
manufacturers contribute fairly when using this work for commercial purposes.

The authors believe that:

1. Healthcare providers, public health agencies, researchers, and non-profit
   organizations should have unrestricted access to tools that improve patient
   outcomes and advance health equity.

2. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that profit from HIV prevention
   products have an ethical obligation to contribute to implementation science
   that supports successful product adoption.

3. Open science principles must be balanced with fair compensation when 
   commercial entities derive substantial value from academic work.

===============================================================================
RATIONALE AND FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
===============================================================================

Q: Why restrict pharmaceutical companies?

A: Pharmaceutical companies profit substantially from HIV prevention products
   (cabotegravir, lenacapavir) that this tool helps implement successfully.
   It is ethically appropriate that they contribute when using academic work
   that adds commercial value. This ensures fair value exchange while
   maximizing patient access through unrestricted healthcare provider use.

Q: Won't this limit the tool's impact?

A: No. Healthcare providers have complete unrestricted access. The tool can
   be implemented in any clinical setting without permission or fees. Only
   pharmaceutical companies using it for internal commercial purposes need
   permissionâand we are committed to granting permission for uses that
   advance public health.

Q: What if I work for a pharmaceutical company as a clinician?

A: If you're providing direct patient care, you can use the tool freely under
   the Patient Care Use exception. Just notify us within 30 days and provide
   annual outcome reporting.

Q: Can a pharmaceutical company fund a clinic that uses this tool?

A: Yes. Healthcare providers retain full rights regardless of funding source.
   The restriction applies to the pharmaceutical company's own use, not to
   organizations they support.

Q: What happens if a pharmaceutical company uses it without permission?

A: Copyright infringement. We encourage good-faith compliance and are open to
   partnerships, but we will protect this work legally if necessary.

Q: Can I publish research using this tool if I receive pharma funding?

A: Yes. Academic freedom is protected. Researchers can use and publish
   findings regardless of funding source. The restriction applies to pharma
   companies' internal commercial use, not to academic research.

Q: Will you actually grant permission to pharmaceutical companies?

A: We are committed to considering all requests fairly, prioritizing public
   health impact. We are open to partnerships involving data sharing,
   validation studies, and health equity initiatives. We will not
   unreasonably withhold permission for uses that advance implementation
   science.

Q: How is this different from "non-commercial" Creative Commons licenses?

A: CC-NC licenses would prohibit hospitals, clinics, and healthcare systems
   because they are commercial entities, severely limiting patient access.
   Our license targets only pharmaceutical manufacturers while preserving
   unrestricted healthcare provider accessâmaximizing public health benefit.

Q: What about generic manufacturers?

A: Generic pharmaceutical companies fall under Pharmaceutical Entity
   definition. However, we view generic manufacturers as advancing health
   equity through affordability. Permission requests from generic
   manufacturers will be viewed favorably, potentially with minimal or no
   requirements beyond attribution and outcome reporting.

Q: Can government agencies use this freely?

A: Yes. Government health agencies, CDC, NIH, WHO, UNAIDS, and all public
   health agencies have unrestricted access.

## WHY THIS LICENSE STRUCTURE?

**Goals:**
1. â Maximum access for healthcare providers (no barriers to patient care)
2. â Maximum access for researchers (advance scientific knowledge)
3. â Fair value exchange with pharmaceutical companies (who profit from products this tool helps implement)
4. â Maintain open science principles (all code/data publicly available)
5. â Enable global implementation (no geographic restrictions)
6. â Support health equity (unrestricted access for safety-net providers)
7. â Protect intellectual property (appropriate recognition and control)

**Rejected alternatives and why:**

â **Full open source (MIT/Apache):** Would allow pharmaceutical companies to use without contributing back or acknowledging the value provided

â **Creative Commons Non-Commercial:** Would prohibit hospitals and many clinics (commercial entities), severely limiting patient access

â **Proprietary/Closed:** Would limit healthcare provider access and contradict open science principles

â **GPL/Copyleft:** Software-specific, unclear application to data/documentation, doesn't address pharma specifically

â **Custom Pharma-Restricted:** Achieves all goalsâmaximum healthcare access, pharma accountability, open science principles
