# Bridging the Gap: LAI-PrEP Implementation Review
## Manuscript Summary and Outline

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Paradox
Long-acting injectable PrEP (LAI-PrEP) with cabotegravir and lenacapavir represents a breakthrough in HIV prevention, demonstrating:
- **>96% efficacy** across diverse populations
- **81-83% persistence** rates (vs. ~52% for oral PrEP)
- **Strong patient preference** (67% prefer injections over daily pills)

**However**, only **52.9% of prescriptions result in injection initiation** — nearly half of motivated individuals never receive their first injection.

### The Core Problem: The "Bridge Period"
The fundamental mismatch exists between:
- **Traditional PrEP cascade**: Designed for oral formulations where prescription = immediate initiation
- **LAI-PrEP requirements**: Mandatory 2-8 week "bridge period" between prescription and first injection

This bridge period, necessary to:
- Confirm HIV-negative status
- Prevent monotherapy in undiagnosed acute infection
- Complete insurance authorization
- Schedule injection appointments

Creates multiple attrition points that eliminate nearly half of potential users before treatment begins.

### Key Innovation
**This paper proposes reconceptualizing the PrEP cascade to explicitly recognize the bridge period as a distinct, measurable step** requiring dedicated management strategies.

## KEY FINDINGS

### Clinical Efficacy Evidence (>15,000 participants)

**Cabotegravir (Every 2 months)**
- HPTN 083: 66% superior efficacy vs. oral PrEP in MSM/transgender women (4,566 participants)
- HPTN 084: 89% superior efficacy in cisgender women in sub-Saharan Africa (3,224 participants)

**Lenacapavir (Every 6 months)**
- PURPOSE-1: ZERO infections in lenacapavir arm among 5,338 cisgender women, >96% efficacy
  - 67% preferred twice-yearly injections over daily pills
  - Included 56 adolescents (16-17 years) with zero infections
- PURPOSE-2: 96% reduction in HIV incidence among 2,183 MSM/transgender/gender-diverse participants

**Once-Yearly Lenacapavir (Phase 1)**
- Plasma concentrations remained above effective levels for ≥56 weeks
- Phase 3 trials planned for second half of 2025

### Implementation Reality: The 47% Gap

**Current State**
- LAI-PrEP comprises only 2.5% of U.S. PrEP prescriptions (2023)
- **Only 52.9% of prescribed individuals receive their first injection**
- **BUT**: Among those who successfully initiate, 81-83% persist (vs. 52% for oral PrEP)

**The Paradox**
- LAI-PrEP was designed to solve the adherence problem
- It succeeds brilliantly at retention once started
- But the solution created an initiation problem
- The same properties that make it excellent for persistence (long half-life) require conservative initiation protocols

## POPULATION-SPECIFIC BARRIERS

### Projected Bridge Period Attrition Rates

| Population | Projected Attrition | Key Barriers |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **General** | 47% | Insurance, testing delays, scheduling |
| **Adolescents (16-24)** | 60-70% | Transportation dependence, privacy concerns, parental involvement, temporal discounting |
| **Women** | 50-60% | Transportation, childcare, medical mistrust, competing priorities |
| **People Who Inject Drugs** | 70-80% | Criminalization, housing instability, healthcare discrimination, competing health priorities |
| **MSM** | 40-50% | Stigma, privacy concerns, insurance delays |

### Critical Equity Concern
If bridge period barriers are not addressed, LAI-PrEP implementation will disproportionately benefit populations already most engaged in HIV prevention, potentially **widening rather than narrowing HIV prevention disparities**.

## PROPOSED RECONCEPTUALIZED CASCADE

### Traditional Cascade (Oral PrEP)
1. Awareness
2. Willingness
3. Prescription
4. Initiation (simultaneous with prescription)
5. Persistence

### Reconceptualized Cascade (LAI-PrEP)
1. Awareness
2. Willingness
3. Eligibility (clinical/testing criteria)
4. Prescription
5. **BRIDGE NAVIGATION** ← NEW EXPLICIT STEP
   - HIV testing within appropriate window
   - Appointment scheduling and attendance
   - Insurance/financial barrier resolution
   - Optional oral lead-in completion
6. Injection Initiation
7. Persistence

### New Metrics Required
- **Bridge period success rate**: Proportion prescribed who receive first injection (currently 53%)
- **Duration of bridge period**: Median time from prescription to injection (target: <14 days)
- **Causes of attrition**: Testing barriers, insurance, no-shows, patient decision, loss to follow-up
- **Population-stratified metrics**: Bridge success for key populations

## EVIDENCE-BASED STRATEGIES

### 1. Eliminating the Bridge: Oral-to-Injectable Transitions
**Most effective strategy**

- **Rationale**: Individuals already on oral PrEP have:
  - Recent HIV testing (within 3 months)
  - Established provider relationship
  - Demonstrated system navigation ability
  - Proven HIV prevention motivation

- **Evidence**: 
  - Atlanta Ryan White Clinics: 50% initiation for LA-ART (vs. general 53% for LAI-PrEP)
  - Projected oral-to-injectable success: **85-90% initiation** (1.5-fold improvement)

- **Implementation**: 
  - Same-day switching protocols (if HIV testing within 7 days)
  - Simplified insurance authorization for switches
  - Provider education on streamlined protocols

### 2. Compressing the Bridge: Accelerated Diagnostic Pathways

**HIV Testing Window Periods**
- Fourth-generation antigen/antibody: 18-45 days (blood) or 18-90 days (fingerstick)
- HIV-1 RNA testing: 10-33 days (earliest detection)
- Third-generation antibody only: 23-90 days (longest window)

**Accelerated Strategies**
- Laboratory rapid turnaround (24-48 hours)
- Point-of-care antigen/antibody testing on injection day
- Presumptive injection with confirmatory testing (for low-risk individuals)
- Dual testing (antigen/antibody + RNA) for highest accuracy

**WHO July 2025 Guidance**: Simplified testing recommendation using HIV rapid tests to support community-based delivery, explicitly prioritizing **access over maximal risk reduction** from extended testing protocols.

### 3. Navigating the Bridge: Patient Navigation Programs

**Evidence**
- San Francisco PrEP navigation: **1.5-fold increase in initiation rates** (HR 1.5)
- Cancer care navigation: **10-40% improvement in treatment initiation**
- Median time to PrEP start: 7 days (with navigation support)

**Core Functions**
- Contact within 24 hours of prescription
- Schedule HIV testing and injection appointments
- Appointment reminders (48 and 24 hours before)
- Assist with transportation arrangements
- Initiate insurance authorization immediately
- Troubleshoot barriers as they arise
- Provide culturally concordant support

**Population-Tailored Navigation**
- **Adolescents**: Transportation assistance, flexible scheduling, confidentiality protections
- **Women**: Childcare support, female navigators, culturally concordant support
- **PWID**: Harm reduction-integrated, low-barrier approaches, no abstinence requirements
- **Transgender**: Transgender peer navigators, anti-discrimination protocols

### 4. Removing Financial Barriers

**Transportation Support**
- Ride-share partnerships (Uber, Lyft vouchers)
- Public transportation fare cards
- Mobile delivery models (bringing services to patients)

**Childcare Support**
- On-site childcare at clinics
- Childcare vouchers for appointments
- Home-based services (telehealth + home visits)

**Bundled Payment Models**
- Episode-based payment covering prescription through first injection
- Capitated payments for HIV prevention (vs. fee-for-service)
- Outcomes-based payments rewarding successful initiation

### 5. System-Level Interventions

**Telemedicine Integration**
- Virtual bridge period counseling
- Remote delivery of test results
- Insurance authorization support via telehealth

**Pharmacist-Led Models**
- Pharmacist prescribing authority (where available)
- Pharmacy-based HIV testing and injection
- Extended hours and convenient access

**Harm Reduction Service Integration (for PWID)**
- SSP colocation of PrEP services
- Low-barrier protocols (no abstinence requirement)
- Bundled services (wound care, HCV treatment, naloxone, LAI-PrEP)

**Community-Based Distribution**
- LGBTQ community centers
- Faith-based organizations
- Mobile clinics for underserved areas

## CONCLUSIONS

### The Fundamental Reframe

**FROM**: "Can we retain people in LAI-PrEP?"
- **Answer**: Yes, demonstrably (81-83% retention)

**TO**: "Can we get people started on LAI-PrEP?"
- **Answer**: Currently only 53%, but addressable through systematic interventions

### Key Insights

1. **The initiation barrier is structural, not behavioral** — created by inherent tension between pharmacological safety (requiring HIV confirmation before long-acting administration) and implementation practicality (minimizing delays that create attrition)

2. **The bridge period is invisible in current cascade models** — Traditional PrEP cascade designed for oral formulations doesn't capture this unique LAI-PrEP challenge

3. **Population-specific barriers create equity paradox** — Populations facing greatest structural barriers may experience highest attrition, potentially widening HIV prevention disparities despite LAI-PrEP's superior clinical efficacy

4. **Evidence-based solutions exist** — Oral-to-injectable transitions, accelerated testing, patient navigation, financial barrier removal, and system-level interventions can dramatically improve initiation

5. **Conservative protocols are necessary but must be balanced** — Islatravir experience demonstrates that long-acting formulations require higher safety standards, but protocols must be sufficiently simplified to prevent losing patients during necessary safety waiting periods

### Path Forward

By **bridging the gap** between prescription and protection through:
- Infrastructure investment
- Protocol innovation
- Patient navigation
- Financial barrier removal
- Equity-focused implementation

We can transform LAI-PrEP from a clinically proven but underutilized tool into a **cornerstone of HIV prevention that realizes its extraordinary efficacy in all populations that need it**.

The paradigm shift from individual adherence (oral PrEP) to system-dependent delivery (LAI-PrEP) requires parallel innovations in cascade conceptualization, measurement, and intervention.
