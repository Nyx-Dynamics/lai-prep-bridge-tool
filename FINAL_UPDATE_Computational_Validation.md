## Key Changes Made to Manuscript

### 1. Title Updates
- **Main Title:** Changed to emphasize computational validation
- **Citation Title:** Shortened to "Computational Validation of LAI-PrEP Bridge Algorithm"

### 2. Abstract Enhancements

**First Sentence - Added Clarity:**
> "We developed and **computationally validated** a clinical decision support **algorithm** synthesizing evidence from major LAI-PrEP trials **using synthetically generated patients based on published clinical trial data**."

**Changed throughout abstract:**
- "tool" → "algorithm" (more technical, appropriate for computational work)
- "validation" → "computational validation" (clear methodology)
- Added explicit mention of synthetic patients

**Final Sentence - Added Positioning:**
> "This **computational validation at UNAIDS global target scale** demonstrates exceptional algorithmic precision with policy-grade statistical accuracy, **establishing proof-of-concept for prospective clinical validation studies**."

### 3. Simple Summary Updates

**Enhanced to include:**
- "computationally validated this **algorithm**"
- "using synthetic patients based on published clinical trial data"
- "This **computational validation** establishes the foundation for **prospective clinical testing** and real-world implementation"

Changed ending from:
- ❌ "This tool is ready for implementation"

To:
- ✅ "This computational validation establishes the foundation for prospective clinical testing and real-world implementation"

### 4. Conclusions Section Reframed

**Opening paragraph now states:**
> "This study presents the first **computational validation** of a clinical decision support **algorithm** for LAI-PrEP bridge period navigation, progressively tested from 1,000 to 21.2 million **synthetic patients**..."

**Changed throughout:**
- "tool" → "algorithm"
- "validation" → "computational validation"
- "implementation readiness" → "readiness for prospective clinical validation"

**Added new concluding statement:**
> "The **computational validation establishes algorithmic precision** and demonstrates scalability at policy-relevant scales, **positioning the tool for the critical next phase: prospective validation in real-world clinical settings**."

## Transparency and Scientific Integrity

### What We're Making Crystal Clear:

1. **Methodology:** Computational validation using synthetic patients
2. **Data Source:** Based on published clinical trial data and implementation studies
3. **Purpose:** Establish proof-of-concept and algorithmic foundation
4. **Next Steps:** Prospective clinical validation in real-world settings
5. **Current Status:** Ready for clinical testing, not yet clinically validated

### What We're NOT Doing:

❌ Hiding the synthetic nature  
❌ Claiming clinical validation without clinical data  
❌ Overselling as "implementation ready"  
❌ Using vague or misleading language  
❌ Calling it "theoretical" (which sounds speculative)  

### What We ARE Doing:

✅ Clear, transparent methodology  
✅ Appropriate positioning as computational/algorithmic work  
✅ Following standard development pathway (computational → prospective → implementation)  
✅ Emphasizing strengths (policy-grade precision, global scale, evidence synthesis)  
✅ Positioning for next phase (prospective validation)

## Comparison: Before vs. After

### Title
**Before:** Validation of a Clinical Decision Support Tool for Long-Acting Injectable PrEP Bridge Period Navigation: Progressive Validation from 1,000 to 21.2 Million Patients

**After:** Computational Validation of a Clinical Decision Support Algorithm for Long-Acting Injectable PrEP Bridge Period Navigation at UNAIDS Global Target Scale

**Improvement:** Clearer methodology, removed confusing numbers, added policy context

### Abstract Opening
**Before:** "We developed and validated a clinical decision support tool..."

**After:** "We developed and computationally validated a clinical decision support algorithm synthesizing evidence from major LAI-PrEP trials using synthetically generated patients based on published clinical trial data."

**Improvement:** Explicit about computational nature and synthetic patients

### Abstract Closing
**Before:** "This represents the largest validation of any HIV prevention decision support tool, with policy-grade statistical precision suitable for WHO/UNAIDS guidelines."

**After:** "This computational validation at UNAIDS global target scale demonstrates exceptional algorithmic precision with policy-grade statistical accuracy, establishing proof-of-concept for prospective clinical validation studies."

**Improvement:** Positions as computational validation, clearly states next step is prospective clinical validation

### Conclusions
**Before:** "This validated decision support tool provides an evidence-based framework for the next phase of HIV prevention: not whether to prescribe LAI-PrEP, but how to ensure prescriptions translate into protection."

**After:** "This computationally validated algorithm provides an evidence-based foundation for prospective clinical validation and real-world implementation. The computational validation establishes algorithmic precision and demonstrates scalability at policy-relevant scales, positioning the tool for the critical next phase: prospective validation in real-world clinical settings."

**Improvement:** Clear about computational validation status, explicit about need for prospective clinical studies
