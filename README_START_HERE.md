# Summary: Incorporating Graphics into Your LaTeX Manuscript

## What I've Prepared for You

I've created a complete package for incorporating your two visualization graphics into your MDPI Viruses manuscript. All files are ready to use.

## Files in Your Outputs Directory

### 1. Figure Files (Publication-Ready)
- **figure1_cascade_comparison.png** - The circular cascade comparison diagram
- **figure2_critical_insights.png** - The critical insights summary

### 2. Implementation Guides
- **LATEX_CODE_SNIPPETS.txt** - Copy-paste ready LaTeX code for all insertions
- **FIGURE_INSERTION_GUIDE.md** - Detailed guide with explanations and context
- **FIGURE_PLACEMENT_RATIONALE.md** - Why figures are placed where they are

## Quick Start: 3 Steps to Add Figures

### Step 1: Add Package (Preamble)
Add after `\documentclass{...}` and before `\begin{document}`:
```latex
\usepackage{graphicx}
```

### Step 2: Place Figure Files
Put the two PNG files in your LaTeX project directory (same folder as your .tex file)

### Step 3: Insert Figure Code
Copy the code from `LATEX_CODE_SNIPPETS.txt` and paste into your manuscript at:
- **Figure 2**: End of Section 1.4 (after the paradox discussion)
- **Figure 1**: In Section 2.1 (after introducing bridge period concept)

## Figure Specifications

### Figure 1: Circular Cascade Comparison
- **Placement**: Section 2.1 "Traditional vs. LAI-PrEP Care Cascades"
- **Size**: Full page width (7 inches)
- **Type**: Side-by-side comparison showing cascade steps
- **Key message**: Oral PrEP loses people AFTER initiation (adherence problem); LAI-PrEP loses people BEFORE initiation (access problem)

### Figure 2: Critical Insights
- **Placement**: Section 1.4 "The Implementation Reality"
- **Size**: Full page width (7 inches)
- **Type**: Four-panel summary with key statistics
- **Key message**: Visual summary of the implementation paradox - LAI-PrEP solves adherence but creates new barriers

## Why These Placements Work

1. **Figure 2 comes first** (in Introduction) to establish the problem framework visually
2. **Figure 1 comes second** (in Methods) to show detailed cascade mechanics
3. Both are **full-width figures** (`figure*` environment) for maximum visual impact
4. **Captions are descriptive** so figures can stand alone
5. **Text references** integrate figures into narrative flow

## Technical Details

### LaTeX Environment Used
```latex
\begin{figure*}[!t]  % Full-width, top of page
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{filename.png}
\caption{...}
\label{fig:label_name}
\end{figure*}
```

### Why `figure*` Instead of `figure`?
- Spans both columns in two-column format
- Better for comparison diagrams
- Makes text readable at publication scale
- MDPI commonly uses this for key illustrations

### Figure References in Text
Use `\ref{fig:label_name}` to reference figures:
- `Figure \ref{fig:cascade_comparison}` for Figure 1
- `Figure \ref{fig:critical_insights}` for Figure 2

## Print Quality Assessment

### Figure 1 (1900 × 869 pixels)
- ✓ Excellent quality at 7" width (~271 DPI)
- ✓ Text remains readable
- ✓ Ready for publication

### Figure 2 (1448 × 446 pixels)
- ✓ Good quality at 7" width (~207 DPI)
- ✓ High contrast compensates for lower resolution
- ✓ Acceptable for publication
- Note: Could regenerate at higher resolution if journal requests

## How These Figures Support Your Manuscript

### Your Key Arguments → Visual Evidence

**Argument**: "LAI-PrEP has an initiation problem, not adherence problem"
→ **Figure 1** shows 47.1% lost at bridge navigation (center circle) vs 81-83% persistence
→ **Figure 2** explicitly states this in top panels

**Argument**: "This is structural, not behavioral"  
→ **Figure 1** shows structural barriers (HIV testing, appointments, insurance)
→ **Figure 2** contrasts "post-initiation adherence" vs "pre-initiation access"

**Argument**: "Population disparities vary by modality"
→ **Figure 1** bottom panels show differential impacts
→ **Figure 2** addresses this in bottom-right panel

## Compilation Instructions

1. **First compilation**: Run `pdflatex manuscript.tex`
2. **Second compilation**: Run again to resolve cross-references
3. **Check**: Verify figures appear and references work

If figures don't appear:
- Check file paths match `\includegraphics` commands
- Ensure PNG files are in correct directory
- Check LaTeX log for error messages

## File Organization Options

### Option A: Flat Structure (Simplest)
```
your-project/
├── manuscript.tex
├── figure1_cascade_comparison.png
├── figure2_critical_insights.png
└── Definitions/mdpi.cls
```

### Option B: Organized Structure
```
your-project/
├── manuscript.tex
├── figures/
│   ├── figure1_cascade_comparison.png
│   └── figure2_critical_insights.png
└── Definitions/mdpi.cls
```
(Update `\includegraphics` paths to `figures/figure1_...` etc.)

## Additional Uses for These Figures

Beyond the manuscript, these figures are valuable for:

1. **Conference presentations**: Use as-is or with minimal modification
2. **Grant applications**: Especially Figure 2 for significance sections
3. **Social media**: Both figures communicate clearly at small sizes  
4. **Teaching materials**: Figure 1 excellent for explaining cascade concepts
5. **Policy briefs**: Visual communication of implementation challenges

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Download all files from outputs directory
2. ✓ Place figure PNG files in your LaTeX directory
3. ✓ Add `\usepackage{graphicx}` to preamble
4. ✓ Copy figure code from LATEX_CODE_SNIPPETS.txt
5. ✓ Paste figure code at specified locations
6. ✓ Compile twice with pdflatex
7. ✓ Verify figures appear correctly
8. ✓ Check that cross-references work (e.g., "Figure 1" links to figure)

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Figures don't appear
→ Check file paths and ensure PNGs are in correct directory

**Problem**: Figure numbers wrong (e.g., "Figure 3" instead of "Figure 1")
→ Run pdflatex a second time to resolve references

**Problem**: Figures on wrong pages
→ This is normal - LaTeX floats figures automatically
→ Figures will be near referenced sections

**Problem**: Text too small in figures
→ Figures are sized for 7" width - text should be readable
→ Check PDF at 100% zoom to verify

## Questions?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the FIGURE_INSERTION_GUIDE.md for detailed explanations
2. Review LATEX_CODE_SNIPPETS.txt for exact code
3. Read FIGURE_PLACEMENT_RATIONALE.md for context

All documentation is comprehensive and includes examples!

**Your manuscript will be significantly enhanced with these visualizations. The combination of detailed text and clear graphics creates a compelling narrative about the LAI-PrEP implementation challenge.**
