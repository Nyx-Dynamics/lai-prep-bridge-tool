## CORRECTIONS MADE:

### 1. **Removed Stray Character**
   - **Location**: Conclusions section
   - **Issue**: Stray "c" character before figure environment
   - **Fix**: Removed "c\begin{figure}[H]"

### 2. **Removed Duplicate Figure**
   - **Location**: End of Conclusions section
   - **Issue**: Figure 1 (convergence) appeared twice in the document
   - **Fix**: Removed duplicate at end; figure now appears only once in Results section

### 3. **Added Missing Figure**
   - **Location**: Introduction, Section 1.2
   - **Issue**: figure2_critical_insights.png was uploaded but not referenced in document
   - **Fix**: Added as Figure \ref{fig:critical_insights} after Section 1.2 with appropriate caption explaining the bridge period paradox

### 4. **Fixed Figure Reference**
   - **Location**: Section 3.3, Table caption
   - **Issue**: Incomplete reference "\ref{fig:}"
   - **Fix**: Changed to proper reference "\ref{fig:populations}"

### 5. **Improved Figure Placement**
   - All figures now properly positioned with [H] placement specifier
   - Figures placed immediately after first reference in text
   - Maintained logical flow throughout document

### 6. **Enhanced Document Structure**
   - Workflow figure (figure6) moved to Methods section for better context
   - All tables and figures properly numbered and cross-referenced
   - Caption formatting consistent throughout
